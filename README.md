SPARK APP

--- Community

This app is aimed for students, instructors, and others who are in electrical industry and willing to share, ask and learn anything about electrical engineering and what it is like to work at the industry.

--- Problem

One of the problems is that the passing rate of some universities who took the licensure examination are not satisfactory because of the way the students learn and study. Sometimes, they got surprised when the topics that came out in the board exam are not the ones they've studied and it results to lower scores.

--- Solution

The solution that will help the students is to create a web application called Spark. Spark is an open forum like web application where the user can ask, study and share what they've learned to the public. Each user has an attribute called credibility where it will depend on the number of your upvotes and downvotes in every post that you will make.
